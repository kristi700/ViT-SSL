# ðŸ“š Training Methods

This section explains the learning strategies implemented in ViT-SSL.

- [DINO](dino.md) â€“ a self-distillation approach for learning without labels.
- [SimMIM](simmim.md) â€“ masked image modeling that reconstructs hidden patches.
- [MAE](mae.md) â€“ masked autoencoder with ViT.
- [Supervised](supervised.md) â€“ standard classification.
- [Fine-tuning](finetune.md) â€“ adapt a pretrained model to a new task.
