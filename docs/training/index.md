# 📚 Training Methods

This section explains the learning strategies implemented in ViT-SSL.

- [DINO](dino.md) – a self-distillation approach for learning without labels.
- [SimMIM](simmim.md) – masked image modeling that reconstructs hidden patches.
- [Supervised](supervised.md) – standard classification.
- [Fine-tuning](finetune.md) – adapt a pretrained model to a new task.
